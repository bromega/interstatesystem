    <p>There are 3 types of <b>Interstates</b>: Majors, Minors, Mediums. Majors: Majors often end in a 5 or 0. And they are actual <b>Interstates</b>, Thatâ€™s shared with most Mediums, too. Mediums: Mediums often end in a 3 or 8. Almost all of them are actual <b>Interstates</b>. They are almost never Atlantic-Pacific like Minors though. Minors: Minors are all intrastates, plus a few <b>Interstates</b>. But they are in at least 1 state like Majors. But thankfully they are all <b>freeways!</b></p>

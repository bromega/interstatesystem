    <p>Did you know that some <b>Interstates</b> are totally false? These are Intrastates, They are only in 1 state and the first number is typically very weird. Their spurs also end in the same state. Some good examples are I-96 in Michigan and I-97 in Maryland. This is conflicting because inter means more than 1, and <b>Interstates</b> are in 1 state.</p>
